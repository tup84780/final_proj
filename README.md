# final project

This is my final project!

I learned a lot about the Ren'Py framework through this project. I do not feel that I accomplished all that I wanted to accomplish, but I did learn a lot about data analysis using coding and how to use python
within the ren'py framework. I struggled a lot with the numbers game I wanted to use, but I did accomplish making the quiz "game" in my visual novel. I was disappointed with the outcome of the numbers game, however I 
feel that I learned a lot about Ren'Py and visual novels along the way, something I had never worked with or learned about before. I accomplished more of the data analysis than I originally set out to despite accomplishing less of the game code that I originally set out to.
